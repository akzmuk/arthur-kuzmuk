    text: >
      I am a student in my fourth year at Taras Shevchenko National University
      of Kyiv studying computer mathematics. I'm passionate about transforming
      raw data into actionable insights that empower organizations to make
      informed decisions. I thrive in data-driven environments where I can turn
      complex datasets into clear, actionable recommendations.


      With a strong foundation in statistical analysis and data visualization, I
      am skilled in data wrangling, data cleaning, and data modelling
      techniques. I have expertise in Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, Tableau and
      Python.


      As a forward-thinking data analyst, I am eager to contribute my expertise
      to organizations seeking data-driven excellence, ultimately fostering
      data-informed decision-making that leads to sustainable growth and
      success.

          This project aims to provide valuable insights and predictive models
          for organizations looking to address employee turnover. Employee churn
          can have a significant impact on productivity and overall company
          success. By leveraging exploratory data analysis, data cleaning,
          various data visualizations, and machine learning techniques, this
          project helps organizations make data-driven decisions to reduce
          employee turnover and improve retention strategies.

          In this project, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of mushroom
          data, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building a
          decision tree model to classify mushrooms as either edible or
          poisonous. The project's primary objective was to gain insights into
          the dataset's characteristics, establish patterns, and create a robust
          classification model with a high evaluation score of 1.00.
