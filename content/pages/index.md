          This project aims to provide valuable insights and predictive models
          for organizations looking to address employee turnover. Employee churn
          can have a significant impact on productivity and overall company
          success.

          In this project, I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of mushroom
          data, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building a
          decision tree model to classify mushrooms as either edible or
          poisonous.
